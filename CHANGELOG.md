## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Initial release of Argus Git Provider
- Core provider implementation with full Git repository integration
- Support for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted Git servers
- Multiple authentication methods (personal tokens, SSH keys, basic auth)
- Real-time configuration polling with efficient watch mechanisms
- Branch, tag, and commit SHA reference support for flexible versioning
- Automatic configuration format detection (JSON, YAML, TOML)
- GitOps-ready implementation with complete version control integration
- Comprehensive security testing suite with 50+ attack scenarios
- Thread-safe provider initialization with atomic operations
- Professional fuzz testing suite covering all critical security functions

### Security
- SSRF protection with comprehensive host validation (localhost, private networks, metadata servers)
- Path traversal attack prevention with URL decoding validation
- Git URL injection prevention with strict parsing and validation
- SSH key security validation with file permission checking (0600 or stricter)
- Repository size limits to prevent DoS attacks through large clone operations
- Authentication token security with secure credential handling
- Input validation with URL decoding to prevent encoding bypass attacks
- Whitelist-based host validation blocking dangerous internal addresses
